<h2>Return of the rchat (rchat 1.0 is out)<h2>
<h4>2022-06-07</h4>
  <p>It's been a while since I've updated rchat. Earlier today I decided to improve rchat since I noticed it had many flaws that I thought I could improve on.</p>
  <p>rchat 1.0 brings many improvements. :help, :changelog and :history now have colors, Borders now scale based on the size of your terminal window.</p>
  <p>In addition to this, you can now use ~/.config/rchat/rchatrc to set options. This might be useful if you wanna set settings without using commands. You can also set the border character using the ':set sep' command. :help, :changelog and :donate commands can be used without joining now.</p>
  <p>You can reset all settings using the ':reset' command. You can also open my donation page by using the ':donate' command. Fairly small but very useful release. If you want to install it, you can clone the <a href="https://github.com/speediegq/rchat">rchat repository</a> and run <code>make install</code> as root.</p>
  <p>Gentoo and Arch repositories should be updated soon.</p>
  <p>Have a good day!</p>
