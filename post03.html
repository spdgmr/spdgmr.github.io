<h2>Dear soydevs; Stop making desktop applications bloated.</h3>
<h4>2022-03-10</h4>
  <p>Today I wanted to talk about something else. I guess it&#39;s kinda related to my previous post titled &quot;Stop making Linux user friendly.. sort of&quot;.
  Modern software has this problem, a very huge problem. &quot;Bloat&quot;. Now bloat can be caused by many different aspects. Programming language, poorly written code, unnecessary features, etc. but the main one I wanna talk about is called &quot;Electron&quot;.</p>
  <p>Now if you&#39;re not familiar with Electron, it&#39;s basically a minimal version of Chromium designed to create individual desktop applications from HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This makes it easy to create desktop applications as long as you know a lot about web development.</p>
  <p>In fact many desktop applications you might be using (Almost all of them are proprietary) use Electron.
  Examples of these are: GitHub Desktop, balenaEtcher, Discord, Spotify, and yes, even a text editor, Visual Studio Code or as I like to call it, &quot;SoyDev Code&quot;.

  If you&#39;ve viewed my page, <a href="hate.html">hate</a>, you&#39;ll know that both Electron and the JavaScript programming language is there on my list.</p>
  <p>Either way, JavaScript is a VERY bloated language and is often obfuscated making it harder to see spyware, even if it&#39;s TECHNICALLY open source.
  Now JavaScript is becoming more popular in web development and this fact is pissing people who want a minimal system off.
  So to make it worse, since Electron allows you to turn HTML+CSS+JS into a desktop application, this means JS will be used for software as well.</p>
  <p>You might say, &quot;I have a fast computer so I don&#39;t care if the software is bloated or not&quot; and while that&#39;s a fair point, what if someone doesn&#39;t have a fast computer or just simply likes minimal software. Then they&#39;re essentially forced to use this bloated slow application just because a developer was too lazy to actually learn another language.</p>
  <p>TLDR; The web is extremely bloated and since Electron turns &quot;the web&quot; into a desktop application, software on the desktop is getting bloated too.</p>
  <p>So what do I want? I want developers to STOP using this Electron trash.</p>
  <p>Thank you and have a good day!</p>
