<h2>I am anti-bloat, but why?</h2>
  <p>While bloat may seem like just a meme, the web being bloat is a HUGE problem but since internet connections are getting faster, normies really don't care and developers keep writing stupidly bloated websites when they don't need to be.</p>
  <p>Usually, most of the website is trackers, cookies, spyware and JavaScript that's usually not required to do the task the website is supposed to do.</p>
  <p>To the average normie, these bloated websites are "fancy" and "modern" but little do they know that after a quick look in their browser's cache, that it's not just "nice" aesthetics. </p>
  <h4>tldr; I believe in minimal websites that do only what they were designed to do, which in this case is to display information about me. This website has no tracking, no spyware, and no JavaScript. Just pure webv2 goodness.</h4>
