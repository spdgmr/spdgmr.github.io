<h2>Welcome to my website!</h2>
  <p>Welcome to speedie's personal website. I try to make the Internet and software in general better. I believe in minimal software and especially free software. If you like non-free software then you won't find it here.</p>

  <h2>Software</h2>
<p>Here's a few projects I've worked on/written. I don't really consider myself a programmer but I write stuff occasionally.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://p081.github.io">Project 081</a></li>
  <p>Modification of Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger which runs on Early 2008 Apple Macs. Non-free although my code is free. (non-free)</p>
  <li><a href="elevendebloater.html">elevendebloater</a></li>
  <p>Windows 10/11 "Debloater" tool which cleans up spyware, tracking and bloatware that Windows comes with. (free)</p>
  <li><a href="spde.html">spDE</a></li>
  <p>"speedie's Desktop Environment" or "spDE" is a set of POSIX shell scripts to automatically install my dotfiles on Gentoo, Arch, Void, Debian or Red Hat. (free)</p>
  <li><a href="dfmpeg.html">dfmpeg</a></li>
  <p>Dfmpeg is a dmenu or rofi frontend script for ffmpeg which can record your screen without all the bloat. (free)</p>
  <li><a href="xshbar.html">xshbar</a></li>
  <p>Customizable, minimal and modular xsetrootbar designed to be used with window managers. (free)</p>
</ul>
<h2>I am anti-bloat, but why?</h2>
  <p>While bloat may seem like just a meme, the web being bloat is a HUGE problem but since internet connections are getting faster, normies really don't care and developers keep writing stupidly bloated websites when they don't need to be.</p>
<pre></pre>
  <p>Usually, most of the website is trackers, cookies, spyware and JavaScript that's usually not required to do the task the website is supposed to do.</p>
  <p>To the average normie, these bloated websites are "fancy" and "modern" but little do they know that after a quick look in their browser's cache, that it's not just "nice" aesthetics. </p>
<pre></pre>
  <p>tldr; I believe in minimal websites that do only what they were designed to do, which in this case is to display information about me. This website has no tracking, no spyware, and no JavaScript. Just pure webv2 goodness.</p>
