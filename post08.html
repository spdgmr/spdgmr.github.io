<h2>Facecucks BTFO by rchat 0.5 (rchat 0.5 is here)</h2>
<h4>2022-04-26</h4>
<p>rchat 0.5 is here. It brings a few more commands such as setting how quickly messages are loaded.</p>
<p>It is likely one of the last feature updates, as new features will come in the form of patches.</p>
<p>rchat now has it's own page on my website, you can check it out here: https://speedie.gq/rchat.html</p>
<p>In addition to this, patches are now available. At the time of making this post, there's a .Xresources patch available for 0.5</p>
<p>Please be respectful and don't abuse the new feature.</p>
<p>- To install rchat 0.5 on Gentoo, add my overlay, you can find out how to do so by following this link: https://github.com/spoverlay/splay.</p>
<p>- To install rchat 0.5 on Arch, simply install the AUR package. You can use an AUR helper like 'yay' if you want. Usage with 'yay' is 'yay -S rchat'.</p>
<p>- For other GNU/Linux distributions, you can head over to my GitHub and download the latest version. Or clone it using Git.</p>
<p>The latest release can be found here. Simply download, save to /usr/bin/rchat and chmod +x /usr/bin/rchat.</p>
