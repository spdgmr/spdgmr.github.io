<h2>ElevenDebloater</h2>
<h3>WARNING: I am no longer maintaining this project. Feel free to submit a pull request or an issue but I may or may not fix it. With that being said, this script should be safe to use. It may not completely remove all bloatware though.</h3>
<p><img src="https://windows-cdn.softpedia.com/screenshots/ElevenDebloater_1.png" alt="images"></p>
<p>Windows &quot;debloater&quot; specifically for Windows 11 (now with 10 support) that relies on the App Installer and &quot;winget&quot;
Made this just because I had some free time and was fucking around with 11 build 21996.1</p>
<h3>Pros</h3>
<ul>
<li>Very easy to customize depending on what you want to delete &amp; what to keep</li>
<li>Can easily be fixed when more shit is added to Windows 11.</li>
<li>Batch script so the &quot;source&quot; is always public</li>
<li>Now allows easy reinstallation of deleted apps</li>
<li>Doesn&#39;t require admin if you manually enable it</li>
<li>Not as bloated as other options</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="cons">Cons</h3>
<ul>
<li>Requires modification to the script if you want customization</li>
<li>Messy code</li>
</ul>
<h3>Before running</h3>
<p>Please run &quot;winget list&quot; in CMD and accept the terms. Otherwise nothing will be deleted.
Actually 0.95 may have fixed this problem by doing it automatically. Still try this if you can&#39;t get it to work!</p>

<p>The SoftPedia mirror is unofficial and I never gave them permission to host my software but I greatly appreciate it even though they didn&#39;t ask for permission.
I am however not responsible for any malware found in their version. To be safe, grab the version from <a href="https://github.com/speediegamer">my</a> GitHub</p>
<h3>NOTE: I am not responsible for any data loss caused by this script. I have tested this on many Windows 11 install but please have common sense. Thank you!</h3>
