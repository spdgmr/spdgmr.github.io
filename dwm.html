<h1>dwm</h1>
<p>speedie&#39;s dynamic window manager configuration</p>
<p><img src="img/gentoorice.png" alt="image"></p>
<p>This is my personal always-changing build of <a href="https://suckless.org">suckless.org</a>&#39;s dynamic window manager or <a href="https://dwm.suckless.org">dwm</a>.
It features many different patches which enhances the user experience and has keybinds for everything.</p>
<p>I recommend using my builds of <a href="https://github.com/speedie-de/st">st</a> and <a href="https://github.com/speedie-de/dmenu">dmenu</a> with this as they provide more features which can work together with this build of dwm such as copying the output of a command. It is not strictly necessary though</p>
<h3>Dependencies</h3>
<p>This build of dwm has the following dependencies:</p>
<ul>
<li>libXft-bgra (See Installing libXft-bgra)</li>
<li>libXinerama (Can be disabled if you don&#39;t need multiple monitors)</li>
<li>imlib2</li>
<li>xwallpaper</li>
<li>xsetroot</li>
<li>dmenu (Any build should work if it allows colored fonts, can be replaced with rofi with some effort)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Installation</h3>
<ul>
<li>See dependencies</li>
<li>Install dev-vcs/git using your favorite package manager</li>
<li><code>git clone https://github.com/speedie-de/dwm</code> (Or download a tar.gz, see Download)</li>
<li><code>cd dwm</code></li>
<li><code>sudo make install</code></li>
<li><code>echo &quot;dwm&quot; &gt; ~/.xinitrc</code> If you&#39;re using a display manager, select it in your menu. You may need to add an entry, I'm not entirely sure.</li>
<li>See &quot;Installing libXft-bgra&quot;</li>
</ul>
<h3>Installation (Package manager)</h3>
<p>If you&#39;re running (currently only) Gentoo then you can install my build of dwm using Portage.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>emerge layman</code></li>
<li><code>layman -o <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spoverlay/splay/main/splay.xml">https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spoverlay/splay/main/splay.xml</a> -f -a splay</code></li>
<li><code>layman -S</code></li>
<li><code>emerge dwm-spde</code></li>
<li>Optional: <code>emerge st-spde dmenu-spde</code></li>
</ul>
<h3>Installing libXft-bgra</h3>
<p>This has to be done because this build of dwm supports Color emojis. Now the only problem is that libXft will crash dwm because it doesn&#39;t support this. Therefore libXft has to be patched. This is pretty painful so I built this into the Makefile.</p>
<ul>
<li>For Gentoo: <code>make gentoo-libxftfix</code></li>
<li>For Arch: <code>make arch-libxftfix</code></li>
<li>For other GNU/Linux distributions: <code>make libxftfix</code></li>
</ul>
<h3>Features</h3>
<p>This build of dwm has been patched pretty heavily. See docs/patchlist if you want to know what patches are included.</p>
<h3>.Xresources</h3>
<p>This build has full compatibility with .Xresources. You can see a full list of options in docs/example.Xresources. To use a .Xresources file, simply put it in ~ or ~/.config and restart dwm. You do not need to add it to .xinitrc.</p>
<h3>Important</h3>
<ul>
<li>This build does not keep object files or config.h. Those are automatically deleted after a successful compile. If a compile is not successful, they will not be deleted. If that&#39;s the case, do NOT edit config.h because if you do and it compiles successfully then your changes will be lost.</li>
<li>This build REQUIRES libXft-bgra. If you don&#39;t know what that is, it&#39;s a patched build of libXft which fixes a bug which causes dmenu to crash when displaying certain characters. That can be installed through make <distro>-libxftfix</li>
</ul>
<h3>Keybinds</h3>
<p>Press Super+Control+h to see a list of all keybinds.</p>
<h3>Getting started</h3>
<p>You can easily get started with this build. First, add 'dwm' to your .xinitrc. Once you get into dwm, you'll want to set a wallpaper. If picom and xclip were installed as per the readme, they should automatically run.</p>
<p>To set a wallpaper, if xwallpaper and dmenu are installed simply press Super+Control+Shift+s. This will bring up a dmenu prompt. It will ask you where all your folders are located, generate a config file in ~/.config/swal and then list all your wallpapers. Then simply select one, choose how you wanna set it, choose if you wanna use pywal and the wallpaper is set. It will be set each time dwm is started.</p>
<p>If you're new and this seems like a lot to take in, there's only one keybind you absolutely need to master: Super+Ctrl+h. This will open up a list of every single keybind.</p>
<p>If you're still lost, consider reading the <code>readme</code> file that this build comes with. It has everything you need to know.</p>
<h3>Status bars</h3>
<p>As for status bars, this build of dwm has been patched with extrabar and therefore supports dwmblocks. Here are a few status bars I use or have used in the past</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="xshbar.html">xshbar</a> (most based option)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/speedie-de/xshbar">xshbar</a> (my build)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jornmann/candybar">candybar</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/speedie-de/slstatus">slstatus</a> (my build)</li>
<li><a href="https://tools.suckless.org/slstatus">slstatus</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/joestandring/dwm-bar">dwmbar</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Fsignal</h3>
<p>This build of dwm has been patched with fsignal meaning you can control dwm using shell commands. There&#39;s a shell script included that I wrote (dwmutils) which allows you to control many features of dwm through dmenu. A full list can be found in docs/example.fsignal</p>
<h3>Expanding</h3>
<p>You can easily expand this build of dwm by simply adding keybinds or patching it. That&#39;s the nice thing about suckless software.</p>
<p>As for adding keybinds, just copy the existing binds and change a few things.</p>
<h3>Download</h3>
<p>You can download a tarball of my build. You can find older tarballs on GitHub in the 'tarball' branch.</p>
<p><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speedie-de/dwm/tarball/dwm-spde-6.3.tar.gz">dwm-spde-6.3.tar.gz</a></p>
