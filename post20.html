<h2>rchat 1.3 is out! (I AM GREAT AT PUSHING UPDATES!)<h2>
<h4>2022-06-29</h4>
<p>Alright so, rchat 1.3 has finally been released. Hopefully it does not break any existing patches. If it does then.. well, they should be updated shortly.</p>
<p>So, what changed with update 1.3? Mostly fixing bugs but I did replace <code>~</code> with <code>$HOME</code> as it works better. But in doing so, I introduced a massive bug and it's likely the dumbest thing I've done so far.</p> 
<p>Now, to make this easy and quick, I decided to use <code>sed</code> to replace all instances. Normally this would be fine but the problem is, I ran <code>sed -i "s|~/|$HOME/|g"</code> which was a problem because if you are new to the terminal, $HOME is a variable defined on every GNU/Linux system. This means <code>~/</code> was replaced with <code>/home/anon</code> because <code>/home/anon</code> is my $HOME directory/variable. This meant rchat was broken for everyone except the people who happen to have their user account named anon.</p>
<p>So of course, this release fixes this issue and nothing more.</p>
<p>To install rchat, see <a href="rchat.html">the rchat page</a>.</p>
<p>To update, if you are on rchat 1.2 or newer, simply respond with Y when prompted for an update.</p>
<p>If you are on rchat 0.5 or older (Latest release on the AUR as of 2022-06-29, <code>pacman -R rchat</code> and follow the instructions on the <a href="rchat.html">rchat page</a>.</p>
<p>If you are on rchat 0.5 or older (Latest release on the splay overlay on Gentoo as of 2022-06-29, <code>emerge --deselect rchat</code> and follow the instructions on the <a href="rchat.html">rchat page</a>.</p>
<p>That's it for this update, thank you for reading the blog post, have a good day!</p>
