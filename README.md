### Welcome to [speedie's](https://invidious.namazso.eu/speedie) website. 

I am a [Gentoo Linux](https://gentoo.org) user and I make guides on a wide variety of topics, mostly technology related. I also archive [Wii Homebrew](https://github.com/forwarderfactory/wii) and I work on Apple projects sometimes such as [Project 081](https://p081.github.io). (he/him)

You can probably find me on Discord *speedie#8260* in various servers, including [my own](https://ffdiscord.github.io).
