<h2>What you can expect from Project 081 0.6</h2>
<h4>2022-03-10</h4>
  <p>This is an update for Project 081 users (if there still are any). As this project has slowly died I would like to finally finish it as I have been working on other stuff like gentoo-install, spDE, my RSS feed, sfetch and various other projects.</p>
  <p>After I spent more time with Linux and stuff my older Mac OS X project kinda.. died. So therefore my goal is to finish Project 081 soon so that it&#39;s as good as it can possibly be. All the assets are (hopefully) complete however it has yet to be &quot;compiled&quot; together into an image for the user.</p>
  <p>So while you wait, here&#39;s a list of a bunch of changes i&#39;ve made to Project 081 as well as a few I&#39;m going to do.</p>
<ul>
<li>Project 081 0.6/1.0 now comes with sfetch</li>
<li>Project 081 0.6/1.0 will come with an RSS reader as well as my feed.</li>
<li>Project 081 0.6/1.0 will FINALLY fix AirPort for iMac8,1 users.</li>
<li>Project 081 0.6/1.0 will hopefully boot on all systems.</li>
<li>Project 081 0.6/1.0 will hopefully be a single image with a single package that determines what to install based on sysctl hw.model</li>
<li>Project 081 0.6/1.0 will be an even smaller image</li>
<li>Project 081 0.6/1.0 will have a preinstalled image available.</li>
<li>Project 081 0.6/1.0 will FINALLY come with drivers for newer Apple keyboards</li>
</ul>
<p>That&#39;s basically what you can expect, if you have any more suggestions please create an Issue on GitHub.</p>
<p>That&#39;s all, Have a good day!</p>
