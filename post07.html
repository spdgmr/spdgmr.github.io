<h2>rchat 0.4 is here (Now available on Arch and Gentoo)</h2>
<h4>2022-04-24</h4>
<p>rchat 0.4 has finally been released. This release doesn't bring much of note except a few commands.</p>
<p>However, you can now install rchat easily on Arch Linux through the AUR and Gentoo using my ebuild repository.</p>
<p>To install rchat 0.4 on Gentoo, add my overlay, you can find out how to do so by following this link: https://github.com/spoverlay/splay.</p>
<p>To install rchat 0.4 on Arch, simply install the AUR package. You can use an AUR helper like 'yay' if you want. Usage with 'yay' is 'yay -S rchat'.</p>
<p>For other GNU/Linux distributions, you can head over to my GitHub and download the latest version. Or clone it using Git.</p>
<p>The latest release can be found here. Simply download, save to /usr/bin/rchat and chmod +x /usr/bin/rchat.</p>
