<h2>Forwarder Factory</h2>
  <p>Welcome to Forwarder Factory ⛳</p> 
  <p>Forwarder Factory is a community of Nintendo Wii hackers who try to preserve homebrew and official software so that it can be accessed by anyone years from now as <i>freeware</i>.</p>
  <p>It is owned and hosted by <a href="index.html">speedie</a>. We have an IRC channel on the <a href="https://libera.chat">libera.chat</a> network (#ff) and a <a href="https://ffdiscord.github.io">Discord server</a>.</p>
  <h4>Not sure where to go? Here are a few links!</h4>
  <ul>
     <li><a href="https://ffdiscord.github.io">💬 Discord server</a></li>
	 <p>Feel free to join our Discord community. It's free as in price, although Discord is non-free software. We cannot gurarantee that Discord isn't a chinese botnet that will sell your data.</p>
     <li><a href="https://github.com/ForwarderFactory">💾GitHub organization</a></li>
	 <p>This is the Forwarder Factory GitHub organization. It has most if not all archived media. Please reupload to <a href="archive.org">archive.org</a> if you can.</p>
	 <li><a href="https://github.com/ForwarderFactory/hbc-archive">🍺Homebrew Channel Archive</a></li>
	 <p>This is the Homebrew Channel archive. It has everything we've found regarding the <a href="https://bootmii.org">Homebrew Channel</a>. This includes BootMii, all installers, DVDX and more.</p>
	 <li><a href="https://github.com/ForwarderFactory/wii">🎮Homebrew App Archive</a></li>
	 <p>This is the general Wii homebrew archive. It's mostly Wii homebrew but also official channels. Most are available through NUS.</p>
  <h2>What's our goals?</h2>
  <p>Our goals is to preserve Nintendo Wii homebrew and make it accessible to anyone years later. It's already becoming VERY clear that this stuff is getting rarer and rarer, and a lot of media is already gone after Nintendo shut down the DarkUmbra hacking/piracy forum back in 2017.</p>
  <p>This sent a very strong message; this kind of media must be preserved. Efforts were already being made years ago but preservation wasn't considered as important back when the Wii was at its homebrew peak.</p>
  <h2>How can I help?</h2>
  <p>If you wish to support our efforts, you can take action by doing any of the following:</p>
  <ul>
     <li><h5>Submitting any rare .wad, .elf, .dol, or other Wii related media you find.</h5></li>
	 <li><h5>Reuploading our archives yourself everywhere possible.</h5></li>
	 <li><h5>Promoting Forwarder Factory, ie. sending people a link to this website.</h5></li>
  </ul>
  <h2>How can I send rare media?</h2>
  <p>If you wanna send media, you can send them through the Discord server. Otherwise, please email me. My email is <a href="mailto:speedie@duck.com">speedie@duck.com</a>.</p>
  <h2>Support me</h2>
  <p>If you wish to support me and my preservation efforts, feel free (not forced) to send over some of your Monero. It would be greatly appreciated.</p>
  <p>To do so, simply send your Monero to this address:</p>
