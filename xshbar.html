<h1>xshbar</h1>
<h4>Customizable xsetroot bar designed to be used with window managers.</h4>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71722170/163267664-186ef5d8-c772-4c47-ba80-dacc30e7d51c.png" alt="image"></p>
<h3>Installation</h3>
<ul>
<li>Install git</li>
<li>git clone <a href="https://github.com/speediegamer/xshbar/">https://github.com/speediegamer/xshbar/</a></li>
<li>cd xshbar</li>
<li>make install</li>
<li>See Usage.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Usage</h3>
<p>xshbar must be used with a window manager that supports xsetroot and xsetroot must be installed. First install xsetroot and then make sure your window manager supports xsetroot.</p>
<p>Once you&#39;re sure it does, add xshbar &amp; to ~/.xinitrc</p>
<p>Now follow Basic Editing</p>
<h3>Basic Editing</h3>
<p>In order to use xshbar, it needs to have something to print. With xshbar this is done using plugins. You don't <i>need</i>to use plugins but they make your life way easier.</p>
<p>xshbar no longer comes with plugins so if you want a plugin, you will have to download some.</p>
<p>Plugins can be found later down this wpage.
<h5>cd ~/.config/xshbar</h5>
<p>and then you will be able to see all xshbar configuration files. Let&#39;s say we want xshbar to display our hostname. (There is a plugin but this is without using one)</p>
<h5>If this is the case, edit 'prn' and change the contents of the XSHBAR_CORE_DISPLAY variable. For example to view the hostname, it should contain <code>$(</etc/hostname)</code>.</h5>
<p>Basically you can also print the output of a command by using <code>$(echo foo). Many plugins rely on this feature. Plugins really exist to save system resources and make the process easier.</code></p>

<h3>How to use plugins</h3>
<p>Plugins are extremely powerful in xshbar. With xshbar you can display anything you could imagine with enough effort. You can of course write your own but xshbar already has a repository of user-made plugins written for it.</p>
<p>You can find user-made plugins later down this page.</p>
<p>Before you can use the variables user-made plugins provide, you need to enable them. You could think of this as <code>#include</code> in C or the <code>source</code command in Bash.</p>
<p>To do this, make sure your plugins are in ~/.config/xshbar/plugins.use. This directory contains all user-made plugins.</p>
<p>Now, all you need to do is enable them. Edit your xshbar script. If you used <code>make install</code> to install it, it should be in /usr/bin.</p>
<p>Once you're in the file, you'll want to add a plugin inside the <code>XSHBAR_IMPORT</code> function. For example, to add a plugin named testplugin.plugin, add the following line:</p>
<p><code>. $PLUGDIR/testplugin.plugin</code></p>

<p>Finally, look at the plugin and determine what variables it provides. These can be used in the 'prn' file we edited earlier.</p>
