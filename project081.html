<p>Project 081 is a modified Mac OS X 10.4.10 Tiger image that allows you to install Tiger on your <i>officially</i> unsupported Late 2007 and Early 2008 Apple Macs.</p>
<p>It comes with many drivers and tweaks to improve the experience on unsupported hardware.</p>
<h2>Why does this need to exist?</h2>
<p>Apple Macs released Late 2007 or later officially only support Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard because Apple doesn't care about backwards compatibility. This doesn't matter for most people because Leopard is a fancy new release that brought many features.</p>
<p>But Leopard also dropped 'Classic' support. Classic allowed you to run <i>classic</i> Mac OS 9 applications on Mac OS X. Many users had these fancy new Macs but couldn't run their old Mac OS 9 applications. And Apple refused to allow users to officially install Tiger.</p>
<p>Project 081 aims to solve this by providing a modified Mac OS X image which has customized drivers and settings that work better with the newer hardware of Late 2007/Early 2008 Apple Macs.</p>
<p>This works similar to a Hackintosh. Difference is this doesn't require and use a custom bootloader such as OpenCore, Clover, Chameleon or one of many other bootloaders out there. Project 081 is similar to Linux distributions in that they're a bundle of software, settings, configurations and drivers.</p>
<h2>How does this add better hardware support?</h2>
<p>Essentially, the installer has been modified to run a custom 'Project 081' package or .pkg. This package contains modified system files which replace the originals. You can learn more through the <a href="https://github.com/p081/wiki/wiki">Project 081 Wiki</a>. You can also view the customized packages since I tried my best to support freedom.</p>
<h2>Download Project 081</h2>
<p>You can download Project 081 for free. (as in price)</p>
<p>If you need to, you can follow the <a href="p081-install-guide.html">official Project 081 installation guide</a>. <a href="p081-download.html">[Download]</a></p>
<p>Keep in mind, <strong>Project 081 is based on Apple's proprietary drivers and code. My additional code is fully <i>free software</i> but may be based on non-free software.</strong></p>
